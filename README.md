# style_sphere

There is a main feed home page called Discover filled with people's closets and direct links if customers want to buy new clothes. On the Discover page, it opens to the most popular clothing items (based on clicks) as well as newly uploaded clothes. 

At the top, there is a filter button where you can filter out color or clothing type categories. On the left panel, it opens to suggestions for people you should follow, who you follow, and are following.

Also, I think it would be cool to add a feature at the top of the discovery page similar to Instagram where people can post photos of them in their daily outfits for the public or private groups to see. 

This can get people more followers and fame on the app if they have clothes that people like and want the same or similar style.

There is a personal profile with categories that you upload your clothes into, for example uploading a top into the tops category
In the groups category, you can create a group where a popup shows up asking for input of the group name, adding members, and adding a group photo. 

Below that is all of the users' existing groups that they can click on and browse. In each private group at the top left of every image posted, there is a request button where users can request to borrow clothes from others in their private group.

This leads to the chat feature where users can chat with each other about borrowing clothes on specific nights or ask if they have any specific tops not posted. 

The saved subsection at the bottom is a collection of all of the clothes you have saved and liked since using the app and browsing. You can filter the page to either just show the most recent saves to scroll or filter to browse saved clothes by category.
